# vim-core-rs

`vim-core-rs` is a Rust-facing host integration layer around one embedded
upstream Vim runtime. It is written for LLM-first consumption, with humans as
the second audience. The goal of this README is to remove ambiguity before an
agent reads source code, edits behavior, or integrates the crate into a host
application.

This crate is not a generic editor toolkit. It exists to give another
application access to Vim's modal editing engine, buffer state, selected
rendering data, host-mediated virtual document I/O, and host-managed job
bridging.

## Read this first

Read these documents in order when you need the full mental model.

1. `README.md`
   This page. It explains purpose, invariants, boundaries, and the most
   dangerous assumptions to avoid.
2. `docs/SCOPE.md`
   The formal in-scope and out-of-scope boundary for the crate.
3. `docs/known-limitations.md`
   Current implementation gaps, intentionally incomplete areas, and features
   that exist in the type surface but are not fully implemented.
4. `docs/api-index.md`
   The map to the exhaustive public and internal API references.
5. `docs/api-contracts.md`
   The behavior contracts that matter more than raw signatures.
6. `docs/public-api-reference.md`
   The full crate-public symbol reference.
7. `docs/internal-api-reference.md`
   The implementation-only helper and coordination reference.

## Repository purpose

The crate owns the embedded Vim editing core. The host application owns the
environment around it.

The crate does these jobs:

- Creates exactly one embedded Vim runtime per process.
- Executes Normal-mode and Ex-mode commands against that runtime.
- Extracts coherent snapshots of text, cursor, buffers, windows, undo state,
  search data, syntax chunks, and pop-up menu state.
- Converts file-like commands into host-visible VFS requests instead of
  letting embedded Vim perform direct file I/O.
- Bridges Vim job and channel behavior into host-managed processes through
  virtual file descriptors.

The crate does not do these jobs:

- It does not own the UI event loop or rendering pipeline.
- It does not persist files by itself.
- It does not spawn or supervise real OS processes by itself.
- It does not aim to expose the whole Vim runtime as a general-purpose
  scripting platform.

## Hard invariants

These points are not optional design preferences. They are repository-level
truths enforced by code and tests.

- Only one live `VimCoreSession` may exist per process.
- `VimCoreSession` is stateful, not `Send`, and not `Sync`.
- `take_pending_host_action()` is part of the normal control flow, not an
  optional diagnostics API.
- VFS requests are explicit and host-owned. The host must answer them with
  `submit_vfs_response()`.
- Job execution is host-owned. The host must react to `JobStart`, then feed
  bytes back with `inject_vfd_data()` and lifecycle updates with
  `notify_job_status()`.
- Contract tests are the source of truth for behavior when prose and intuition
  disagree.

## Mental model

The safest way to reason about the crate is as four coupled state machines.

- Session machine
  Owns lifetime, the embedded runtime pointer, and the single-session lock.
- Command machine
  Executes Normal or Ex input and returns one coarse outcome instead of a full
  diff.
- VFS machine
  Tracks buffer-to-document bindings, request sequencing, request ledger
  status, and deferred close behavior.
- VFD machine
  Tracks virtual file descriptors and host-managed job status.

Do not model the crate as "a library that edits files." That framing leads to
incorrect assumptions about ownership, persistence, and concurrency.

## Host responsibilities

An embedding host must implement these behaviors.

- Drain `take_pending_host_action()` until it returns `None`.
- Handle `CoreHostAction::Write` and `CoreHostAction::Quit`.
- Handle every `CoreHostAction::VfsRequest` and send one matching
  `CoreVfsResponse`.
- Spawn real jobs when `CoreHostAction::JobStart` appears.
- Feed stdout and stderr bytes back through `inject_vfd_data()`.
- Report terminal job status through `notify_job_status()`.
- Set UI size with `set_screen_size()` when screen geometry matters.
- Register `set_message_handler()` before a command if Vim messages are part
  of the desired observable behavior.

## Dangerous assumptions to avoid

An agent reading this repository must not assume any of the following.

- Do not assume file writes happen automatically inside the crate.
- Do not assume `CoreCommandOutcome::HostActionQueued` means the side effect
  already completed.
- Do not assume every Ex command reaches native Vim unchanged. A file-like
  subset is intercepted and rerouted through Rust policy.
- Do not assume VFS request IDs are reusable or unordered. They are monotonic
  session-local identities.
- Do not assume the latest `CoreVfsResponse::Saved` always applies. Save
  responses can be rejected as stale when revisions advance.
- Do not assume the embedded runtime owns process execution. It only requests
  host action.

## Source-of-truth hierarchy

When repository artifacts disagree, use this order.

1. Contract tests in `tests/`
2. Rust implementation in `src/`
3. Native bridge implementation in `native/`
4. Documentation in `docs/`
5. README-style summaries elsewhere

This hierarchy is intentional. The crate is contract-driven, and many
observable behaviors are locked by tests rather than by Rust type signatures.

## Repository layout

These paths matter most for reasoning and maintenance.

- `src/lib.rs`
  Public API facade, command routing, snapshot conversion, option accessors,
  message dispatch, and top-level VFS integration.
- `src/vfs.rs`
  VFS request ledger, transaction log, buffer bindings, and deferred close.
- `src/vfd.rs`
  Virtual file descriptor and job-bridge state.
- `native/`
  C bridge and embedded Vim runtime shims.
- `tests/`
  Contract suites that define large parts of the intended behavior.
- `build.rs` and `build_*.rs`
  Bindgen, native compilation, audit generation, and traceability artifacts.

## Build facts that affect behavior

The vendored Vim build is intentionally constrained.

- The generated upstream build runs with `--with-features=normal`.
- The build disables native terminal support.
- The build disables native socket server support.
- The build disables native channel support at configure time, even though the
  crate exposes host-bridged job behavior through its own control plane.

Because of that setup, do not assume this repository behaves like a full
desktop Vim or like Neovim.

## Prebuilt artifacts

By default, consumers do not build the embedded Vim runtime from source.
`build.rs` resolves a target-specific prebuilt artifact, expands it into
`OUT_DIR`, and links the bundled `libvimcore.a`.

The published crate still contains the allowlisted `vendor/vim_src` inputs
required for an explicit source build. That means a crates.io consumer can
override the default path with `VIM_CORE_FROM_SOURCE=1` without checking out
this repository.

This repository currently publishes prebuilt artifacts for these targets:

- `aarch64-apple-darwin`
- `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

Each target artifact contains these files:

- `libvimcore.a`
- `bindings.rs`
- `artifact-manifest.json`

The archive also includes the generated traceability outputs that the
repository tests expect in `OUT_DIR`, such as the compile proof, audit
reports, generated Vim headers, and generated upstream test list.

### Environment variables

Use these environment variables to control the build path:

- `VIM_CORE_FROM_SOURCE=1`
  Builds the embedded Vim runtime from source. This is the expected mode for
  repository development, CI, and release packaging.
- `VIM_CORE_ARTIFACT_BASE_URL`
  Overrides the base URL or local directory used to resolve the prebuilt
  archive. This is intended for validation, mirrors, or local testing.
- `VIM_CORE_ARTIFACT_DIR`
  Overrides the local cache directory used to store downloaded and verified
  prebuilt artifacts.

If a prebuilt artifact is unavailable, the build fails with an explicit error.
The build does not fall back to a source build unless you set
`VIM_CORE_FROM_SOURCE=1`.

## Development and release verification

Repository development uses an explicit source build. Run the checks from the
repository root with these commands:

```bash
VIM_CORE_FROM_SOURCE=1 cargo test
VIM_CORE_FROM_SOURCE=1 cargo publish --dry-run --allow-dirty
```

Do not treat a bare `cargo test` in this repository as the development
baseline. The default build path looks for a GitHub Releases asset whose tag
matches `Cargo.toml`'s crate version. Before that release exists, the build
fails with a 404 by design instead of silently compiling from source.

When you validate the default consumer path before publication, point
`VIM_CORE_ARTIFACT_BASE_URL` at a local directory that contains the packaged
target archives, then run a clean build with `VIM_CORE_FROM_SOURCE=0`.

For a production release, publish GitHub Releases assets for every supported
target before you publish the crate to crates.io. That ordering keeps
`vim-core-rs = "<version>"` consumers from hitting a transient 404 between the
crate publish and the asset upload.

## Vim license notice

This repository vendors and modifies portions of upstream Vim in order to
embed one headless Vim runtime behind the Rust API surface. When you
redistribute this repository or binaries built from it, include the bundled
license files that apply to the shipped code.

The repository uses a split licensing model:

- Original `vim-core-rs` code is licensed under Apache License 2.0. See
  `LICENSE`.
- Vendored and modified Vim sources remain subject to the Vim License. See
  `LICENSE-vim`.

The upstream Vim baseline for the current vendor snapshot is recorded in
`upstream-metadata.json`. The repository-level notice for this modified Vim
distribution lives in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, including the maintainer
contact URL for change requests related to the embedded Vim sources.

## Next steps

Read `docs/SCOPE.md` to understand design boundaries. Read
`docs/known-limitations.md` before planning changes so you do not mistake a
current gap for a guaranteed feature.
