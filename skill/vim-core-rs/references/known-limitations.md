# vim-core-rs known limitations

This file lists current limitations and intentionally incomplete behavior in
`vim-core-rs`. Read it before changing code or relying on an API. The goal is
to prevent both humans and agents from mistaking exposed symbols for fully
realized features.

## Current implementation gaps

The following public methods exist, but the current native implementation does
not yet provide expected dynamic data.

- `is_incsearch_active()`
  Currently returns `false` because the native bridge path still returns a
  placeholder value.
- `get_incsearch_pattern()`
  Currently returns `None` because the native bridge path still returns an
  empty placeholder string.

Treat these as exposed-but-incomplete APIs, not reliable live-state queries.

## Job bridge limits

- The crate does not spawn OS processes itself.
- `CoreHostAction::JobStart` is a host request, not process execution.
- `vim_core_vfd_write()` currently ignores bytes written from Vim and simply
  reports success.
- Job working directory propagation is not fully implemented. A
  `CoreJobStartRequest.cwd` may be `None` even when Vimscript job options imply
  a directory.
- When a job reaches a terminal status, the associated VFDs are closed so Vim
  observes EOF. Late injected data is rejected.

## Local file-command semantics

- For local buffers, `:write` and `:update` enqueue `CoreHostAction::Write`.
- For VFS-backed buffers, `:write` and `:update` enqueue
  `CoreHostAction::VfsRequest(CoreVfsRequest::Save)`.
- For local buffers, `:wq` and `:xit` currently enqueue `CoreHostAction::Quit`
  instead of automatically sequencing `Write` followed by `Quit`.

If a host wants local save-and-quit semantics, the host must coordinate them
after observing the queued action.

## Build and feature limits

- The vendored upstream Vim build disables native terminal support.
- The build disables native socket server support.
- The build disables native channel support in the vendored configure step.
- Some upstream Vim tests are intentionally skipped because they require those
  disabled features.

Do not infer missing coverage from those skips. They reflect declared feature
boundaries.

## Architecture limits

- Only one `VimCoreSession` may exist per process.
- The crate is not a multi-session or multi-tenant engine.
- The crate does not own semantic parsing, virtual text, terminal emulation,
  plugin hosting, or generalized editor UI.
- The VFS ledger is session-local and not persisted across sessions.
- The VFD manager is global process state and is cleared when a session drops.

## Interpretation rules

- If a type or method exists, first check whether contract tests exercise it.
- If a method is present but the native bridge returns placeholder data, treat
  it as exposed-but-incomplete.
- If a behavior depends on host action, the crate is only one half of the
  feature.

[public-api-reference.md](public-api-reference.md) for the callable surface.
